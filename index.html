<h1>Loyalty Shift Index</h1>
<p>A Smarter Way to Measure Customer Loyalty Momentum</p>
<p>The Loyalty Shift Index (LSI) is a supplemental metric to Net Promoter Score (NPS) that quantifies the directional movement of customer sentiment over time. Unlike static NPS snapshots, LSI highlights the magnitude and quality of change, whether a customer is becoming more loyal, staying neutral, or declining in sentiment.
This gives CX teams early warning signals and a sharper view into what actions are working,  or not.
